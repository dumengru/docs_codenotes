Sync your phone contacts with ChatApp. ChatApp saves your phone contacts and adds anyone with an email address to your contact list!

> Syncing contacts with your phone restores any previously synced contacts.

To sync your contacts:

1. Open your *User Settings* on your phone app
2. Select the **Sync Contacts** button
3. Authorise ChatApp permissions
4. Select some or all of your contacts
